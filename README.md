# Project-1
amountOfP is a program to report the number of processors and the amount of cache in each CPU.
amountOfFM is a program to report the free memory in the system and the number of memory buffers.

Design
amountOfP: This C program reads the /proc/cpuinfo file, which contains details about the system's CPUs on Linux systems, and displays information about the processors and their cache sizes.

amountOfFM: This C program reads the /proc/meminfo file, which is a file on Linux systems that provides information about the system's memory usage. The program specifically extracts and displays details about the free memory and buffers.
